# 🎧 Automated YouTube Mixtape Creation

### Full-Stack Audio → Video Automation System

A production-style, modular application that automates the creation of YouTube-ready mixtapes from multiple audio tracks.

Built with:

* FastAPI – Backend API
* Streamlit – Interactive Frontend
* MoviePy – Video Processing Engine
* Uvicorn – ASGI Server

---

# 🚀 Overview

This project transforms a simple audio workflow into a complete full-stack automation system capable of:

✔ Uploading multiple audio tracks
✔ Creating smooth DJ-style fade transitions
✔ Generating timestamped YouTube descriptions
✔ Converting static image + audio → MP4 video
✔ Managing background processing jobs
✔ Running with one-tap locally

This is not just a script — it is a deployable full-stack system.
